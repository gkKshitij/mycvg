# mycvg
cvgenrator refactoring from mycvg

What it does:
1) take input from user [done partially]
2) saves it in db [it does that on itself]
3) makes a tex file
4) renders the tex file to pdf to view/download

for use just clone master and run just as normal django projects
i.e execute "python manage.py runserver" in terminal
havnt made the requirements file as there are still left to be added,
so just install the libraries when it fails to compile with particular error
